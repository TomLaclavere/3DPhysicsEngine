# Goal

The goal of this example is to show the robustness of the free fall using the numerical simulation 3DPhysicsEngine.

# Features

This examples will add different objects to the physical world, and will make same fall following the Earth gravity. They will stop when hitting the ground. \\
The acceleration, speed, position and time when touching the ground will be computed for all objects and compare with analytical computations described in the following. \\
This example does not include bouncing yet, objects will stop instantaneously when hitting the ground.

# Analytical Computation

# Future Improvement

Implement bouncing of objects.

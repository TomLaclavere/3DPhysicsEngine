# Mathematics

- Try to add constexpr and noexcept in functions definition  
- **Vector :**
  - Try to use 3 decimals instead of an array 
- **Matrix :**
  - Try to use 9 decimals instead of an array of 3 Vector3D
  - Verify normalize method : currently, it is using Gram-Schmidt orthonormalisation. Check if this method is well suited for my application
  - Add test for normalization
- **Quaternion :**
  - Try to use 4 decimals instead of one Vector3D and one decimal
